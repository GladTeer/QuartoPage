Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the rmd & rendered file via Canvas.\nIn this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you’ll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\nI want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you’d be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me notes of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we’ll discuss more.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The gt tidy and kable functions can help!). Modelsummary also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\nMake sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc."

In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\nage: Age in years.\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\nregion: Region where interview took place\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”\nThe data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder."

You can do this by converting the \\(\\beta_0\\) parameter out of the log-odds metric to the probability metric. Make sure to include the 95% confidence intervals. Then interpret the results in a sentence or two–what is the basic thing this probability tells us about?\n\n\n\nCode\nb0 &lt;- as.numeric(intercept_only_model[1]) # get coef\n\nb0_transformed &lt;- exp(b0) / (1 + exp(b0)) # logistic transform\n\nci_lower = b0 - 1.96 * 0.0393685\nci_upper = b0 + 1.96 * 0.0393685\n\n#transforming confidence intervals of coefficients into probabilities\np_lower = exp(ci_lower)/(1+exp(ci_lower))\np_upper = exp(ci_upper)/(1+exp(ci_upper))\n\n\nInterpretation: We have 95% confidence that the probability of mass_trans_spend_right being 1 instead of zero is .51 to .55\n\nNow let’s fit a model using the demographic factors - age,sex, sei10 - to predict the odds a person is satisfied with spending on mass transportation.

This equates to the odds of thinking the spending amount is right in females being 1.29 times the odds of thinking this in men (95% CI [1.13, 1.44]).\nThe predicted probability for females to be satisfied with spending on mass transportation is 55.9% (95% CI [53.3%, 58.5%]) and that of males is 49.5% (95% CI [46.7%, 52.4%]).\n\nVerify this.\n\nNext, consider the relationship between age and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation.

The odds ratio is 1:.99 which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of age, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about .99, or approximately -.006 per unit increase in age, holding other factors constant.\n\nConsider the relationship between SES and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation. Interpret the coefficient of SES in terms of the logs odds and OR of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation. Please include the 95% CIs around each estimate. ß\n\n\n\nCode\nbses &lt;- coef(m1)[\"sei10\"]\n\nci_lower_lo = bses - 1.96 * 0.0016609\nci_upper_lo = bses + 1.96 * 0.0016609\n\nci_lower_or = 0.9938530 - 1.96 * 0.0016609\nci_upper_or = 0.9938530 + 1.96 * 0.0016609\n\n\nA one unit increase in SES index is associated with a decrease in the log-odds of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation by 0.0062 units (95% CI [-0.0094, -0.00297]), holding all other variables constant. The odds ratio is less than 1 (0.9937922), which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of SES index, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993, or approximately 0.7% per unit increase in SES index, holding other factors constant (95% CI [0.9905976, 0.9971084]). ## Marginal effects\n\nLet’s examine the results on the probability scale.\n\n\nCalculate the marginal effects of sex, age, and SES on mass transportation spending. You can use the margins package function margins discussed in your textbook or you can use the marginaleffects package avg_slope avg_comparisons discussed in lecture. Interpret each estimate.\n\n\n\nCode\navg_comparisons(m1, comparison = \"difference\") %&gt;% \n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ncontrast\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\ns.value\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n\nage\n+1\n-0.0015153\n0.0005579\n-2.716128\n0.0066050\n7.242216\n-0.0026088\n-0.0004219\n\n\nsei10\n+1\n-0.0015304\n0.0004039\n-3.789362\n0.0001510\n12.692830\n-0.0023219\n-0.0007388\n\n\nsex\n1 - 0\n0.0630688\n0.0196461\n3.210251\n0.0013262\n9.558495\n0.0245632\n0.1015743\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effect of age is -0.0015153 (95% CI [-0.0026088, -0.0004219]). So, for each additional unit increase of age, the probability of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decreases by approximately .15 percentage points, holding other factors constant (p = .007).\nThe marginal effect of SES is 0.0015304 (95% CI [-0.0023219 -0.0007388]). For each one-unit increase in the socioeconomic index, the probability of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decreases by approximately .1 percentage points, holding other variables constant.\nThe marginal effect for being female compared to male is 0.0630688 (95% CI [0.0245632,0.1015743]). This indicates that females are, on average, about 6.3 percentage points more likely than males to be satisfied with mass transportation spending, holding other factors constant."
